**Direct. Private. Temporary.**

Zoru is a zero-infrastructure video chat application. It creates a direct, peer-to-peer (P2P) encrypted connection between two devices using WebRTC.

-   **No Accounts**: Just generate a code and share it.
-   **No Servers**: Media streams never touch a server (signaling only via PeerJS).
-   **No Data**: Nothing is stored. When the call ends, it's gone.

## Features

-   **Instant 1-on-1 Video Calls**: Crystal clear P2P video and audio.
-   **Private**: End-to-end encrypted media streams.
-   **Temporary**: Room codes are ephemeral.
-   **Responsive**: Works on desktop and mobile.
-   **Controls**: Toggle Mute/Video, easy link sharing.
-   **Donation System**: Built-in support for creators (Lightning Bitcoin & Coffee).

## Technology

Built with simplicity and privacy in mind:

-   **HTML5 / Vanilla JS**: No frameworks, no build steps.
-   **PeerJS**: Handles WebRTC signaling.
-   **CSS variables**: Easy theming (Dark Mode default).
